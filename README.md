# Sign_Language_Translator
Normal people don’t understand Sign Language Translator, which creates a communication gap that needs to be filled. In this work, we present a computer vision system with neural networks architectures. 

# Introduction
Sign language is a set of gestures that deaf people use to communicate. Unfortunately, normal people don’t understand it, which creates a communication gap that needs to be filled. In this work, we present a computer vision system with neural networks architectures. The architecture is a CNN followed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for extracting features. 
Sign language, as we know, is a way of communicating using hand gestures and movements, body language and facial expressions, instead of actually speaking. Like any other spoken languages such as English or Hindi, there are a bunch of different sign languages across the globe. As time passes technology is rapidly evolving and improving the way the world operates. Barriers for people with special needs are diminishing, as projects of the past two decades have unfolded.

# Problem Formulation
Considering the present unfortunate pandemic situation which resulted in the immense increase in use of technology and digitalization. Our project mainly revolves around creating a machine learning model that would help the people with special needs in helping them adapt to these scenarios. One such way is by creating a model with the help of computer vision and deep learning which can assist people with special needs easing the communication process.

# Objectives of the Work
1. Researching commonly used signs for communicating
2. Processing different landmarks used for locating and identifying hand signs
3. Generating dataset for frequently used signs during communication
4. Creating a model using created dataset
5. Adding customized signs and their meaning for quicker conversations
6. Predicting user’s message using generated model
7. Displaying and saying aloud predicted words
